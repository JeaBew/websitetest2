abstract: There is a substantial lack of studies in productive skills of German students in English as a foreign language. Based on this research gap, the present repeated measurement study evaluated the competence to write argumentative essays and synthesis texts of n = 838 11th graders from upper secondary schools while also collecting data on receptive skills (listening and reading comprehension). Findings show that a substantial number of students (approximately 60%) reach level B2 or higher of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages one year before leaving upper secondary school, which is the official standard for upper secondary school writing. Furthermore, analyses show that all foreign language skills increased over the course of one school year and that students with different educational emphases in their school tracks (i.e., with a primary focus on languages vs. natural science vs. social science vs. other subjects) differ significantly in their writing skills. Specifically, students who pursue language-centered studies clearly outperformed all other students as expected. Findings are discussed with respect to normative performance expectations of upper secondary schooling.
